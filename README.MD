# Private Internet Access
Private Internet Access is the world's leading consumer VPN service. At Private Internet Access we believe in unfettered access for all, and as a firm supporter of the open source ecosystem we have made the decision to open source our VPN clients. For more information about the PIA service, please visit our website [privateinternetaccess.com](https://privateinternetaccess.com).

# Android Application
With this application, consumers can easily enable and communicate with the Private Internet Access services. It provides interfaces for authenticating, purchasing plans, updating servers, getting connectivity updates, handling VPN profiles etc.

## Installation

### Requirements
 - Git (latest)
 - Android Studio (Stable channel)
 - Gradle (latest)
 - ADB installed
 - NDK (latest)
 - Android 4.1+

#### Download Codebase
Using the terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/pia-foss/android.git *folder-name*`

type in what folder you want to put in without the **

or use a graphical interface like Android Studio's to clone the repo.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the cloned folder and once there type in:

`git submodule init`

This will initialize the submodules of our project. Then:

`git submodule update --recursive`

This will download and install the required submodules in our project.

Next is to download the Open VPN submodules. Next:

`cd openvpnTunnel/`

This will moves you into our Open VPN code folder. Next:

`git submodule init`

This will initialize the submodules of this project. Then:

`git submodule update --recursive`

This will download and install the remaining submodules in this project.

#### Building

Once the project is cloned and submodules are updated, the project will build once opened in Android Studio. This will require building the binaries for the underlying modules and configurations. This can take a while for certain computers and is only done on complete clean and rebuilds. You can see progress in the gradle console. Once completed, the app will be able to be run on a device connected to the computer or an emulator running on your computer.

*Please note that Android 4.x emulators are broken with VPNs and will not connect.*
